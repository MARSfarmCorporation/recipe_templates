I want to convert those settings we discovered for growing a plant into a different format. Please remember these rules and help me to begin that outline. Start by providing me an outline of the steps, their start times, and the setting values.
 
--the variable of start_time inside of each step is formatted as [hour, minute] and it should be assumed that each phase is a 24 hour period of time. If the first start_time in light_intensity is at [9, 5] and the second is at [22, 35] then the first settings will run from 9:05 AM until 10:35 PM (photoperiod of 13.5 hours)
--Always begin the first start_time at [0, 1] for everything except pump_amount.

--settings for pump_amount are in ML of water. Always begin the first start_time for this step 2 hours before the photoperiod begins. Calculate the number of required start_times by dividing the total daily ML of water required by 80 ML (max amont per start_time) until the required amount is added (add a comments to the step to indicate the total amount added). 
--settings for temperature are in Fahrenheit, with a max of 90F. Always provide a separate day and night temperature based on the photoperiod. (Add comments to indicate day/night and duration of thermoperiod).
--circulation fan should always be "on" with a setting of 1. 
--settings for light_intensity is on a scale of 0-255, here is the mol of photons per meter per day at germination height in the center of MV1 for various photoperiods at max light_intensity. Add comments to indicate the calculated photoperiod, the lights that are on, and DLI being provided. The table below shows light_intensity settings and the corresponding value (umol per meter per second) that can be used to calculate photoperiod. For example, if the light_intensity setting was [0, 255, 255, 255] for 10 hours that would provide a DLI of 16.128 and if it was [0, 255, 255, 0] then it would provide a DLI of 8.64.

-White at 100% [0, 0, 0, 255]: 204.7
-Red & Blue at 100% 255 [0, 255, 255, 0]: 240
All colors at 100% [0, 255, 255, 255]: 448
Far-red at 100% [255, 0, 0, 0]: 3.7 (do not use unless explicitly told)
